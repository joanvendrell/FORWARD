# FORWARD: Feasibility Oriented Random-Walk Inspired Algorithm for Radial Reconfiguration in Distribution Networks

**FORWARD** is a library that provides state-of-the-art methods for finding radial configuration in distribution networks. 
Proposed algorithm generalizes traditional greedy methods on Minimum Spanning Tree problem in order to construct spanning
forests accomplishing the non-linear constraints of flow distribution.


See an example of its performance below:
